Do you enjoy reading or writing reviews for the media you engage with (books/movies/games) on your blog? Why or why not? What makes for a good review? What do you accomplish by writing one? What are you looking for when you read a review of something? How do reviews work differently on the web vs. in print? Do they still have value in a world of abundance? Do they increase your enjoyment of the art you’re engaging with?

Following from the above, what do you feel about being overly critical, mean, or downright inflammatory in your writing on the web? It can be easy to get page views by writing something clearly inflammatory, but do you want to put your name on a post that comes off as angry or frustrated? What if your anger is justified? What if it’s valuable to write that post? How do you call something out without seeming like a person who just complains about things? How do you criticize a work of art/company/product/person constructively?

- What is a blog post, really? The world of letters is full of different formats and genres of writing:
    - essays,
    - journalism,
    - fiction,
    - scientific papers,
    - manifestos,
    - diary entries,
    - travelogues,
    - memoirs,
    - biographies,
    - news updates.
- How is a blog post different from all of these traditional forms of writing? Is it similar to one of these forms or an amalgamation of everything? Or does it stand on its own as a completely new form of writing in the digital age?
- Strange intimacies people share on their website, as a form of archival and note keeping.
