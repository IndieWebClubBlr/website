# IndieWebClub Bangalore Website

This repository contains the source code for the [IndieWebClub Bangalore website](https://blr.indiewebclub.org/), a static site generated using Python. The website displays upcoming and past events, and a blogroll of recent posts from the community.

## Features

- Event feed and calendar
- Member blogroll page and feeds
- Member directory
- Webring
- CI/CD

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `make`

### Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/IndieWebClubBlr/website.git
    cd website
    ```

2.  **Set up the environment and install dependencies:**
    The `Makefile` provides a convenient way to set up a Python virtual environment and install the required dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

    ```bash
    make setup
    ```

    You can run `make` or `make help` at any time to see a list of all available commands.

3.  **Activate the virtual environment if required:**
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

## Usage

The following commands are available through the `Makefile`.

### Common Commands

-   **`make build`**: Build the website. This will generate the static files in the `_site` directory. For faster builds during development, you can enable caching by running `make build CACHE=true`.
-   **`make serve`**: Serve the website locally for development. You can view the site at `http://localhost:8000`.
-   **`make watch`**: Automatically rebuild the site when files change.

### Other Commands

-   **`make install`**: Install or update dependencies if `requirements.txt` changes.
-   **`make clean`**: Remove the generated `_site` directory.
-   **`make clean_all`**: Perform a full cleanup, removing the `_site` directory, the `venv`, and the cache.

## How it Works

The website is generated by the `generator.py` script. This script performs the following steps:

1.  **Parses `blogroll.opml`**: Reads the list of community blog feeds.
2.  **Fetches feeds**: Concurrently fetches the content of each feed.
3.  **Detects weeknotes**: Automatically separates weeknote entries from regular blog posts based on title and tag patterns.
4.  **Fetches events**: Retrieves event information from the Underline Center Discourse API.
5.  **Generates the homepage**: Ggenerate the homepage with the aggregated content.
6.  **Generated static pages**: Converts Markdown files in the `pages/` directory to static HTML pages.
7.  **Generates feeds and calendar**: Creates Atom feeds for the blogroll and events, and an iCalendar file for events.
8.  **Generates member directory**: Creates a member directory page listing all community members.
9.  **Generates webring**: Creates webring redirect links that connect to random member websites.

The generated site is then deployed to the `gh-pages` branch of the repository.

## Configuration

The project's behavior can be customized through the `config.py` file. This file includes settings for request timeouts, content length limits, feed and calendar file names, and more. Some of the key options you might want to modify are:

-   `MAX_SHOWN_ENTRIES`: The number of posts to display per blog on the homepage.
-   `MAX_FEED_ENTRY_AGE`: The time window in days for fetching recent blog posts.
-   `MAX_FEED_ENTRIES`: The maximum number of entries to fetch from each feed.
